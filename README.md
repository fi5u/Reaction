# Reaction
A single/multiplayer game for [Puck.js](https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js)

A single button press turns the game on. LEDs will flash, then a random amount of time will pass. The blue LED will flash, then quickly as possible you have to press the button. The first player will set the fastest reaction time. Next turn you have to react faster to press the button after the blue LED flash. If you have a new fastest time, green LEDs will flash slowly. If you haven't beaten the current fastest time, then a red LED will flash. Continue to take turns to beat the quickest time - press the button once to start the random countdown.

To reset the current fastest reaction time, hold down the button for three seconds, release when the blue LED flashes.
